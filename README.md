# Basics of Version Control with GitHub
A simple guide to using `git` for GitHub version control. Learn how to create, merge, and delete branches.


## What is "Git Flow"?
Git Flow is a branching strategy that helps developers manage features, releases, and fixes efficiently. It organizes the development process using different branches:

- **`main`** → Stable branch containing production-ready code.
- **`develop`** → Active development branch where new features are merged.
- **`feature/*`** → Temporary branches for developing new features.
- **`release/*`** → Prepares a version for release, ensuring stability.
- **`hotfix/*`** → Emergency fixes applied directly to `main`.

Using this structured approach makes collaboration easier and keeps your codebase clean.


## How to start for beginners
It covers these following steps:
- Setup the Repository
- Create Main and Develop Branches
- Work on a New Feature
- Merge the Feature into Develop
- Prepare for a Release
- Merge Release into Main and Develop
- Apply a Hotfix (Urgent Bug Fix in Main)
- Merge Hotfix into Main and Develop
